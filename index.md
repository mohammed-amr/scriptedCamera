Scripted Camera Control Through Visual Tracking

Note that at rare times, the frame rate of the system drops from ~50Hz to ~14Hz and the camera loses track for a while before regaining or needing user input. This is due to the poor thermal design of the laptop being used (the XPS 15). When it gets too hot it throttles the CPU and GPU. 

Not that in all of these examples, no pre training happened to better understand the appearance of the target. The target was not asked to slowly rotate before intense filming starts to improve the featur encoding history later on. This is the hardest setting for the system.

Example of a long unedited bike ride. This scenario would be difficult for the camera operator had he not been using the automated system.

Deliberate use of a wrong cost function to illustrate a point. When detections are noisy, using the kalman filter association model to eliminate what it thinks are bad track/detection combinations is a bad idea. This is explained in detail in the text.
